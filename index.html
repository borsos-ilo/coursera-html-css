                    <br>One of the cool things about us is that we pride ourselves on being human-forward—that means we don’t just value the people that sit in our chairs, but those that stand behind them, as well.</p>

                    <h1>Sustainability</h1>
                        <p>The beauty industry sends 877 pounds of waste to landfills every single minute. We're changing that.
                        <br>
                        Hair Day is a certified green salon. Through our partnership with Green Circle we're able to recycle and repurpose up to 95% of the salons waste.
